The Licensed Services and Software may permit the Licensee to enter, copy, edit Content that constitutes non-public personal information of individuals other than the Licensee; the Licensee shall not use, store or disclose any such information without the express consent of the individuals to whom it relates.

The Licensor will not assist Licensee in making this determination, nor can the Licensor provide Licensee with legal advice as to intellectual property rights or privacy laws</p>

If, on the other hand, Licensee or Licensee's attorney determines it is permissible to proceed and include End-user Generated Content from the Licensed Services and Software, the Licensor asks Licensee to correctly designate the Licensor trademark(s) when referring to the Licensed Services and Software in the notice or copyright portion of Licensee's paper, project, or product.
